0.49    2017-07-20  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [dist] Bump prereq version Log::ger to 0.019 for the bug fix
	  [RT#122547].

	- Switch from Log::Any to Log::ger.


0.45    2017-05-16  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Remove skip_NEXT and skip_problematic options. These options were
	  added to ease importing to database, but turns out that since clearing
	  transactions "SETORAN KLIRING BI" will appear at the top of the daily
	  transactions list, the import process itself must be able to handle
	  this out-of-order group. So these options are not so useful.


0.44    2017-05-15  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add option skip_problematic to skip problematic entries, e.g.
	  SETORAN KLIRING BI. UPDATE 2017-05-16: removed in 0.45.


0.43    2015-09-08  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Remove debugging statement, d'oh.

	- Tweak example code.


0.41    2015-09-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Switch from Log::Any to Log::Any::IfLOG.


0.37    2015-06-09  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Fix/tweak check regex.


0.36    2015-04-29  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- (Temporarily) downgrade total credit/debit check (sometimes the
	  statement returned by the server fails this check, e.g. probably when
	  the total credit already includes a transaction, but that transaction
	  has not shown up in the statement). UPDATE: this is caused by recent
	  update in KlikBCA system where apparently the mutation page is no
	  longer real-time (there is probably a 15 minute delay or maybe more).
	  So the total credit is already updated with some very recent
	  transactions, but the transactions have not shown up yet in the
	  mutation page. So now this check is no longer mandatory.


0.35    2015-04-28  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Split CLIs to its own dist: App-IndonesianBankingUtils to reduce
	  deps.

	- [Incompatible change] Become more standard by formatting datetime
	  as iso8601 (2001-02-03T04:05:06) instead of '2001-02-03
	  04:05:06'.


0.33    2015-02-06  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Adjust to Perinci::CmdLine -> Perinci::CmdLine::Classic.


0.32    2014-12-10  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Use new name of renamed/split module SHARYANTO::String::Util ->
	  String::Indent.


0.31    2014-09-09  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Update regex of Sun/Sat transaction list. There is now "DR KOREKSI
          BUNGA" (aside from "CR KOREKSI BUNGA").


0.30    2014-08-26  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - bin/download-bca: Replace App::Options with Perinci::CmdLine. Location
          of config file is now changed, as per Perinci::CmdLine, from
          ~/.app/download-bca.conf to ~/download-bca.conf. The syntax of the
          configuration is the same (it's actually now IOD, but IOD supports the
          App::Options configuration syntax).

        - [Incompat] bin/download-bca: --profile is now --config-profile.


0.29    2014-05-17  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes.

        - Replace File::Slurp with File::Slurp::Tiny.

        - Relax the request id regex a bit.


0.27    2013-11-03  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [NEW FEATURES]

        - Add simulation mode and save dir, for help in debugging. In
          non-simulation mode, if save_dir is specified, will save HTTP
          responses as YAML files in this dir. When in simulation mode, instead
          of actually sending requests to network, will use this saved
          responses.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Get error message from BCA error page, e.g. the "MAAF UNTUK SEMENTARA
          TRANSAKSI TIDAK DAPAT DILAKUKAN" message.

          sending TE header.


0.22    2012-02-08  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Add script: parse-bca-statement (a simple script that calls
          parse_statement() and dumps result to YAML)

        - Add option to parse_statement(): return_datetime_obj, to allow
          returning dates as 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS' strings instead of DateTime
          objects.

        - Add note that parsing copy-pasted text from GUI browser is deprecated.

        - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: parse_statement now always returns 3-element
          arrayref instead of depending on list/scalar context. Sorry for this,
